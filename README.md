# BTree Project

## Introduction
This project implements a B-Tree data structure in Java. It is designed to provide efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. The implementation showcases the use of B-Trees for managing large datasets that do not fit entirely in memory.

## Features
- Efficient data insertion, deletion, and search operations.
- Scalable to large datasets.
- Includes a sample application demonstrating the B-Tree usage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above.
- Apache Ant for building the project (optional, if you use `build.xml`).

### Building the Project
To build the project, navigate to the project directory and use the following command if you have Apache Ant installed:
```
ant -f build.xml
```
Alternatively, you can compile the project using your IDE or directly with the `javac` command, ensuring all dependencies in the `lib` directory are included in the classpath.

### Running the Project
After building, run the main application class from your IDE or using the `java` command, specifying the required classpath for any external libraries located in the `lib` directory.
